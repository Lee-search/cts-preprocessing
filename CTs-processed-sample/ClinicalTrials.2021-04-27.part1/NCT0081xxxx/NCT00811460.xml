	<brief_title>A Study of Taspoglutide in Type 2 Diabetic Patients</brief_title>
	<brief_summary>
      This crossover study will assess the effect of 2 doses of Taspoglutide on first- and
      second-phase insulin secretion in patients with type 2 diabetes. Patients will receive a
      continuous subcutaneous infusion of a)the Immediate Release Formulation (IRF)of Taspoglutide
      300 micrograms/day for 2 days followed by Taspoglutide 800 micrograms/day for 2 days or
      b)saline placebo for 2+2 days. After a washout period of 10-15 days, patients will be
      crossed-over for further treatment;those receiving Taspoglutide in period 1 will receive
      placebo in period 2, and vice versa. On days 2 and 4 of each period, insulin secretion
      patterns will be assessed. The anticipated time on study treatment is &lt;3 months, and the
      target sample size is &lt;100 individuals.
