	<brief_title>Pharmacokinetics (PK) of 20 mg Teduglutide in Participants With Moderately Impaired Hepatic Function Compared to Healthy Participants</brief_title>
	<brief_summary>
      This is a study to compare the pharmacokinetic profile of teduglutide in healthy participants
      with normal hepatic function with participants who have moderate hepatic impairment.
    </brief_summary>
	<detailed_description>
      24 participants (equally divided between participants with normal hepatic function and those
      with moderate hepatic impairment (defined by the protocol as a Child-Pugh classification of
      grade B score of 7-9)will be given a single injection of teduglutide (20mg) through
      subcutaneous injection into the abdomen. Blood samples would be taken within 30 minutes of
      dose through 24 hours post-dose. Participants in both groups are matched up by sex, age, BMI,
      and renal function.

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an informed consent form (ICF)

          -  Willing and able to be confined at the study site for approximately 2.5 days

          -  Female participants who are postmenopausal, surgically sterilized, or women of
             childbearing potential (WOCBP) using an effective form of birth control during the
             study

          -  WOCBP must have a negative urine beta human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) result at
             screening (Days -28 to -2) and check-in (Day -1)

          -  Negative urine test for selected drugs of abuse and alcohol at screening and check-in
             (Day-1)

        Inclusion for participants with Impaired Hepatic Function (in addition to above criteria):

          -  Documented moderately impaired hepatic function defined by a total score of 7 to 9 on
             the Child-Pugh Classification at screening and check-in

             clinically stable as deemed by the investigator

             is known to be secondary to alcohol abuse

             underlying disease is under control

          -  Participants with normal hepatic function will be matched collectively as a group by
             gender, age, and BMI with the participants with moderately impaired hepatic function.

             the participants with moderately impaired hepatic function with regard to renal
             function In addition to inclusion criteria # 1 to 8, participants with normal hepatic
             function must also meet the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for
             participation in this study:

             participant with moderately impaired hepatic function

          -  Medically healthy with normal or clinically insignificant clinical results at
             screening and check-in

             them unsuitable for the study

          -  Participants with Impaired Hepatic Function (in addition to exclusion criteria 1-4):

          -  Acceptable Child-Pugh score (Grade B, score of 7 to 9), which is associated with
             conditions such as metastatic cancer rather than impaired hepatic function

          -  Participants with Normal Hepatic Function (in addition to exclusion criteria 1-4
